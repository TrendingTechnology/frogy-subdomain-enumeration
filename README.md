# Frogy's Subdomain Enumeraton - It's not yet another Subdomain Enumeration tool
An automation tool that scans sub-domains using multiple tools. Most importantly, it greps all the words from the first, second and N level of subdomains and creates a wordlist. Then uses crt.sh to brute force every single name to identify any hidden subdomains out there. <br/>
